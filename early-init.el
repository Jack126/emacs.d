;;; early-init.el --- Emacs 27 introduces early-init.el, which runs before init.el
;;; Commentary:
;; Runs before package and UI initializetion happens.
;;; Code:

(unless (>= emacs-major-version 29)
  (error "ONLY EMACS v29+ IS SUPPORTED!"))

;; For speed up the startup, please do NOT forget reset it to default
;; after Emacs after-init-hook, or it may cause freezes.
